# HangDroidApp

I am a 17 year old learning how the android platform works and how to implement my existing knowledge of Java to create some fun apps. This, for example, is a simple app that I have created in the past two days and will continue to work on to further my education in the subject area. This app currently has the following features...

## Features:
  - Single player
  - Scoring system
  - Random picking from over 8000 common english words(Other languages coming soon!)
